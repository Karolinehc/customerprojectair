The success of a **digital marketing campaign** is often measured by its ability to **attract relevant traffic**, engage users effectively, and convert them into qualified leads that have the potential to become loyal customers or clients.

By analyzing these metrics, advertisers can assess the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns and make data-driven decisions to optimize their marketing strategies.

**"Call Reporting"** feature provided by **Google Ads** allows business owners to track and measure the performance of call extensions and call-only ads in their **Google Ads campaigns**. This feature provides valuable statistics and insights about calls generated through your ads, including details like the **time of the call**, **date**, **duration**, **caller area code**, and whether the call was a missed call or a completed call.

So with **Call Reporting**, you can gain a better understanding of how your call-focused campaigns are performing, when customers are most likely to call, and which **campaigns or keywords** are driving the most calls. This information can help you optimize your campaigns and make data-driven decisions to improve your advertising strategy.

Therefore "typecall" refers to different types of call interactions or call-related features within your **Google Ads campaigns**. Specifically,**"Click-to-Call for mobile devices"** . Click-to-Call" is a feature in **digital advertising**, particularly in mobile advertising, where users can click on a phone number displayed in an ad to initiate a **direct phone call to the advertiser**. This is particularly useful for businesses that want to encourage immediate contact or inquiries from potential customers who are browsing on their mobile devices. You can track:

Click-to-Call Desktop: If your campaigns also have click-to-call functionality on desktop devices, you might see a separate entry for **"Click-to-Call Desktop."**

**Call Duration**: You could track the duration of each call, helping you understand how engaged users are during their conversations with your business.

**Call Outcome**: This could indicate whether the call was completed successfully, missed, or dropped before connecting.

Call Source: As discussed earlier, this might specify whether the call came from the **Search Network**, **Search Partners**, a specific ad group, or a campaign.

Location: The **geographic location** or area from which the call was made.

Device Type: Whether the call was initiated from a **mobile device**, **tablet**, or **desktop computer**.

**Call Extension**: If you're using different call extensions or numbers, you might categorize calls based on the specific extension used.

**Ad Position**: The position of the ad on the search results page when the call was initiated.

For example [click on here](http://karolinehc.com/blogs/google-ads-call-report-python/), if you have different call extensions set up with different phone numbers for various products or services, the "Call Extension" variable could indicate which specific call extension was clicked on by the user, giving you insights into which parts of your business are generating the most phone calls.
